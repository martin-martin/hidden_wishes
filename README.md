# Secret Wishes

a birthday hack :)

## what's this?
Code that scans literature for secret "happy birthday" wishes. ðŸ˜‰

## why?
Because today is my birthday ðŸŽ‚ , and I felt like coding something connected to that.

## how does it work?

**Note**: For this to work you need to have python's `nltk` package ([install like so](https://www.nltk.org/install.html)), as well as the associated Gutenberg corpus, that you can obtain running `nltk.download()` in a python shell. Then select the Gutenberg corpus from the avaialble corpora.

If those requirements are met you can proceed to download and run `hidden_wishes.py`. This creates a couple of HTML pages containing the novels' edited text with the strings `happy` and `birthday` highlighted.
There is also a count of the occurances of each string right at the top of the document. Have fun!

PS.: `parents` send most wishes!
