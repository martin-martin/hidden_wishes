# Secret Wishes

a birthday hack :)

## what's this?
Code that scans literature for secret "happy birthday" wishes. ðŸ˜‰

## why?
Because today is my birthday ðŸŽ‚ , and I felt like coding something connected to that.

## how does it work?
Download and run `hidden_wishes.py`. This creates a few HTML pages containing the novels' edited text with the strings `happy` and `birthday` highlighted.
There's also a count of the occurances of each string right at the top of the document. Have fun!

PS.: `parents` send most wishes!
